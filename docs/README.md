# What is a Minimap?
A minimap is an element of the HUD usually placed at a screen corner that represents a map, but its size is much smaller. The function of a minimap is to help the player get orineted.

The common elements usually included in minimaps are the position of the player, the allies and enemies, buildings, terrain, and points of interests. Elements that are not visible for the player, should not appear in the minimap.
